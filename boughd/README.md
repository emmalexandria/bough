# boughd

`boughd` is a non-user facing application for generating file trees. 
It runs as a daemon and watches the file system for changes, outputting updates to a 
given file. 

This was created primarily for my personal Neovim plugin 
[`bough.nvim`](https://github.com/emmalexandria/bough.nvim).
