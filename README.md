## Features
- ASCII, HTML, Markdown, or ANSI terminal output support.
- Emoji or Nerd Font based icons.
- Colours based on filetype (for ANSI and HTML output).
- Wrapping support if a fixed width is desired, including support for wrapping descriptions.
- Theming support
- Support for [project files](#project-files)

### Project files
This functionality is designed for projects which want to have a file tree with descriptions explaining the purpose of files and directories. 
Bough will look for a `.boughconf` file in the directory you point it to. This file follows a simple plain text format. Here's the 
`.boughconf` for the Borough repo itself. 



```
# Directories are indicated by a trailing slash. 
# We could also add a description for a file called 'src' by ommitting the trailing slash
# The first part of any line is the folder or file name, and then the description for that file comes after a space.
./src/ The source code for the borough binary.
./src/main.rs The entry point of borough

# Fill this out later

# If a --- delimeter is found, everything after it acts as default values for borough arguments like depth, hidden files, output type, and icon style.
---
# Possible values: ascii,html,ansi,markdown
output=txt
# Possible values: 0 >= n =< usize::MAX, 0 indicating usize::MAX
depth=0
# Possible values: none,emoji,nerd,unicode
icons=none



```

Running `borough gen` will create a new `.boroughconf` file listing all the files that `borough` finds. This respects the `a` argument 
and `.gitignore`.

Comment lines can be included with a `#`.
